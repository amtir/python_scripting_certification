NumPy & Pandas & matplotlib

Objectives
-------------
Creater arrays using NumPy
NumPy to perform mathematical operations on arrays
Read and write data from text/csv files into arrays and vice-versa
Understand Pandas and employ it for data manipulation
Understand and use the data structures available in Pandas
Read and write data between files and programs

What is Data Analysis? 
-----------------------
Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

Prepare a Model
Analyses Trends and make decision

Date Analysis, Manipulation, Visualization (NumPy, Pandas, mathplotlib)


NumPy
------
NumPy is a package for scientific computing 
--> Multi dimensional array (matrix)
--> Methods for precessing arrays
--> Elements by element operations
--> Mathematical operations like linear algebra

Operations: Mathematical and logical, Fourier transformation and shape manipulation, Linear algebra and random number generation

Why NumPy?
Metadata (data about the data, extra information)

The ndarray is a multi-dimensional array object consisting of two parts. Tha actual data, some metadata which describes the storage data. They are indexed just like sequences are in Python, starting from 0.


Each element in ndarray is an object of data-type object (called dtype)
An item extracted from ndarray, is represented by a Python object of an array scalar type

Reading and writing from text files loadtxt/savetxt
-------------------------------------
arr = np.loadtxt('file.txt')
np.savetxt('newfile.txt', arr)

reading and writing from CSV files
savetxt / genfromtxt
new_arr = np.savetxt('test.csv', arr, delimiter=',')
arr = genfromtxt('my_file.csv', delimiter=',')

Pandas 
--------
Pandas is an open-source Python library providing efficient, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Than name Pandas is derived from "Panel Data", an Econometrics from Multidimensional data. 

Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data: 
Tabular data with heterogenously-typed columns
Ordered and unordered time series data
Arbitrary matrix data with row and column labels
Any other from of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure.

Data Structures in Pandas 
--------------------------
Pandas provides 3 three data strutures. (All are build on top of NumPy array)
Data Structure | Dimensions | Description
1 - Series, 1 , Labeled homogenous array of immutable size
2 - DataFrames, 2, Labeled, heterogeneously typed, size-mutable tabular data structures
3 - Panels, 3, Labeled size-mutable array

(*) All the above data structures are value-mutable


1 - Series single-dimentional array stores homogenous data
    Value-mutable and size-immutable


2 - DateFrame
A DataFrame is a 2D data structure in which data is aligned in a tabular fashion consisting of rows & columns
pandas.DataFrame(data, index, dtype, copy) 


Date: of multiple type ndarray, lists, constant, series, dict 
index --> default range(
dtype --> Date type of each column
copy --> shallow/deep-copy? true false? 







Loading CSV data into DataFrame 
--------------------------------
table = pandas.read_csv("/home/john/Datasets/USArrest.csv")


Storing Data in CSV Files
--------------------------
Data present in DataFrames can be written to a CSV file using the to_csv() function 
table.to_csv("/home/john/Datasets/USArrest.csv")


Storing Data in Excel Files
------------------------------
table.to_excel("/home/john/Datasets/USArrest.xlsx")
